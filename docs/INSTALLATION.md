# Installation

> This document tracks the installation contract as the plugin is built. Steps for features that
> have not landed yet are marked **(pending)**.

## 1. Require the package

```bash
composer require madcoders/sylius-giftcard-plugin
```

## 2. Register the bundle

```php
# config/bundles.php

return [
    // ...
    Madcoders\SyliusGiftCardPlugin\MadcodersSyliusGiftCardPlugin::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

## 3. Import the configuration

```yaml
# config/packages/madcoders_sylius_gift_card.yaml

imports:
    - { resource: "@MadcodersSyliusGiftCardPlugin/config/config.yaml" }
```

## 4. Import the routes

```yaml
# config/routes/madcoders_sylius_gift_card.yaml

madcoders_sylius_gift_card_admin:
    resource: "@MadcodersSyliusGiftCardPlugin/config/routes/admin.yaml"
    prefix: /admin

madcoders_sylius_gift_card_shop:
    resource: "@MadcodersSyliusGiftCardPlugin/config/routes/shop.yaml"
    prefix: /{_locale}
    requirements:
        _locale: ^[A-Za-z]{2,4}(_([A-Za-z]{4}|[0-9]{3}))?(_([A-Za-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?$
```

## 5. Extend your entities **(pending)**

The plugin adds state to three Sylius models. Apply the interface and trait to your own entities:

- `Product` - `giftCard: bool`, marking the product as a gift card product
- `Order` - the gift cards applied to the order
- `OrderItemUnit` - the gift card generated for the unit

The exact traits and the Doctrine mapping they need are documented here once the model phase lands
(see `docs/PLAN.md`).

## 6. Run the migrations **(pending)**

```bash
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
